Verse 1  The sun comes up, it’s a new day dawning;  It’s time to sing Your song again.  Whatever may pass and whatever lies before me,  Let me be singing when the evening comes.  Chorus  Bless the Lord, O my soul,  O my soul, worship His holy Name.  Sing like never before, O my soul.  I’ll worship Your holy Name.  Verse 2  You’re rich in love and You’re slow to anger,  Your Name is great and Your heart is kind;  For all Your goodness I will keep on singing,  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.  Chorus  Bless the Lord, O my soul,  O my soul, worship His holy Name.  Sing like never before, O my soul.  I’ll worship Your holy Name.  Verse 3  And on that day when my strength is failing,  The end draws near and my time has come;  Still my soul sings Your praise unending,  Ten thousand years and then forevermore.  Chorus  Bless the Lord, O my soul,  O my soul, worship His holy Name.  Sing like never before, O my soul.  I’ll worship Your holy Name.  Bless the Lord, O my soul,  O my soul, worship His holy Name.  Sing like never before, O my soul.  I’ll worship Your holy Name.",
